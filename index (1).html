    <p class="text-muted" style="text-align: center;">Sport pertains to any form of competitive physical activity or game[1] that aims to use, maintain or improve physical <br>
      ability and skills while providing enjoyment to participants and, in some cases, entertainment to spectators.[2] Sports <br>
      can, through casual or organized participation, improve one's physical health. Hundreds of sports exist, from those <br>
      between single contestants, through to those with hundreds of simultaneous participants, either in teams or competing as <br>
      individuals. In certain sports such as racing, many contestants may compete, simultaneously or consecutively, with one <br>
      winner; in others, the contest (a match) is between two sides, each attempting to exceed the other. Some sports allow a <br>
      "tie" or "draw", in which there is no single winner; others provide tie-breaking methods to ensure one winner and one <br>
      loser. A number of contests may be arranged in a tournament producing a champion. Many sports leagues make an annual <br>
      champion by arranging games in a regular sports season, followed in some cases by playoffs.</p>

    <img class="image" src="canteen.jpg">
    <p class="text-muted" style="text-align: center;">A cafeteria, sometimes called a canteen outside the U.S., is a type of food service location in which there is little or<br> 
      no waiting staff table service, whether a restaurant or within an institution such as a large office building or school; <br>
      a school dining location is also referred to as a dining hall or lunchroom (in American English).[1] Cafeterias are <br>
      different from coffeehouses, although the English term came from Latin American Spanish, where it had and still has the <br>
      meaning "coffeehouse".</p>

    <h2 class="text-success text-capitalize" style="text-align: center; text-decoration: underline;">School Church</h2>
    <section class="sec" style="text-align: center;"  id="church">
    <img class="image" src="church.jpg">
    <p class="text-muted" style="text-align: center;">A church, church building or church house is a building used for Christian worship services and <br>
       other Christian religious activities. The earliest identified Christian church is a house church founded between 233 and 256.<br>
        From the 11th through the 14th centuries there was a wave of church construction in Western Europe.<br>
        <br>
      Sometimes the word church is used by analogy for the buildings of other religions.[1] Church is also used to describe the <br>
      Christian religious community as a whole, or a body or an assembly of Christian believers around the world.[2]<br>
      <br>
      In traditional Christian architecture, the plan view of a church often forms a Christian cross; the center aisle and seating <br>
      representing the vertical beam with the bema and altar forming the horizontal. Towers or domes may inspire contemplation of <br>
      the heavens. Modern churches have a variety of architectural styles and layouts. Some buildings designed for other purposes <br>
      have been converted to churches, while many original church buildings have been put to other uses.</p>
